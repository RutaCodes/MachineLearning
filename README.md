# Machine Learning

In this repository you can find various tasks that are performed during model development. 


Add:
- cross validation for stratified suffle split (with example - write kind of a blog post showing how it splits data and why it's more beneficial than random split for data like mine. Emphasize that I haven't found any examples with environmental data like mine and not with as many groups as I have)
- model function that tests multiple ML algorithms at the same time, giving cross validation results with chosen model result metrics
