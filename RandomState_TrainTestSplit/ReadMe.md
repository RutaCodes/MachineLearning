# Problems with *train_test_split()* function

The *train_test_split()* function provided by the sklearn Python package is widely used for dividing data into train and test datasets. However, potential risks of using this function are rarely explored. Here, I explore how one of the function inputs - *random_state* - influences model results. Internally, the *train_test_split()*  function uses a seed to pseudorandomly separate data into train and test datasets. It is pseudorandom because each seed value corresponds to the same data subdivision. This outcome is very important as it allows to easily reproduce model results, as assigning the same integer value to *random_state* will lead to the same train/test data division. Unfortunately, data will be split differently with each value that is assigned to *random_state*, which will then lead to varying model results, as a different set of samples were used to train ML model each time.
