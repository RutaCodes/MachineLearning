*Sample_size_accuracy.py* - code that tests how models results depend on train/test split ratio. For context: Model predicts daily micro-pollutant concentrations.

*run_models_sample_test.py* - function used in *Sample_size_accuracy.py* that outputs train + test mean cross validation scores for 5 models: Linear Regression, Support Vector Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, Gradient Boosting Regressor, XGBoost Regressor.

Results are represented in PDF file in Figures folder.
